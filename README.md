Welcome to Expl.AI!

1) Introduction

It started with an idea. "What if we made AI as dumb as possible?"
But that was a dumb idea. So instead I thought, "What if we made AI explain any concept to anyone?"
I figured this would be a relatively simple project to introduce me to React, Node.JS, and LLMs.
The goal is to make LLMs as inclusive as possible.

2) Future work
   a) Get a basic working front-end done
   b) Allow the back-end to take text input from the front-end
   c) Make it look good
